# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is an interactive tool for overlapping and dynamically cropping images. It allows users to upload up to four images, position them, and then generate cropped versions of the overlapping areas.

## Implemented Features

### Image Loading and Display
- Users can upload up to four images (A, B, C, D) using file input buttons.
- The uploaded images are displayed in an overlap container.

### Image Manipulation
- Users can move the images within the overlap container using arrow key controls.

### Cropping and Processing
- A "Generate Cropped Images" button becomes active when images are loaded.
- The tool calculates the intersection of the images and generates cropped versions.
- It also creates a processed version of the cropped images (inverted and desaturated).

### UI/UX
- The application has a clean and intuitive user interface.
- It includes loading indicators and clear instructions.
- A "Reset All" button allows users to start over.
- The design is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

## Current Plan

- Restore the project to its previous state after accidental file deletion.
- Push the restored project files to the GitHub repository.
